              THE OPPORTUNITY MATRICES FOR CHAIN INNOVATIVE TRANSFORMATION OF
              ECONOMY: THE CITE CONCEPT

            <section>
              <strong>«Fly-Up»</strong> – is an infrastructure project, which is
              a platform for the placement and development of innovative ideas.
              What are the differences between the project and the usual StartUp
              platform?
            </section>
            <section>
              The project is based on the theory of the topological
              representation of economic processes and works in three
              directions:
              <p>
                I - intended for developers of “teams” (using the algorithm of
                the topological representation of economic processes on the
                world map represents those economic systems in which a request
                for innovative products is formed);
              </p>
              <p>
                II - for investors (allows, in addition to choosing the
                presented project presentations, to calculate possible
                cooperation options and financial results based on the algorithm
                of the topological presentation of economic processes);
              </p>
              <p>
                III - for researchers (allows initiative and active people who
                do not have professional programming skills, etc., to present
                the idea of their project and form (attract) a team of
                like-minded people to work on the project)
                <a

                  growth-startup-funding-by-industry </a
                >. As recent studies have shown, all countries strive to enter
                the sphere of “open access” in many research areas, and there is
                an urgent need for the formation of such projects. Moreover,
                this niche is free in many countries. Why create a bike? Let's
                join forces to shape the digital infrastructure!

                First of all, the maximum concentration of thematic content, the
                formation of a discussion platform for the search for
                like-minded people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, to optimize the success of modern innovative products

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>
              Economic systems are continuously becoming more complex. The
              methods used to describe them are also complex, which is the basis
              for the study of the theory of networks, nonlinear dynamics, and
              complex systems with suddenly arising properties that are not
              susceptible to conjectures and that contradict reductionism. This
              is the direct result of the scientific and technical progress and
              innovations that provide economic systems with additional
              opportunities for growth and development. For example, the
              introduction of computer technologies and networks into economics
              allows us to reach a qualitatively new level of efficiency in the
              organization of economic processes, particularly through
              automation and robotization of business processes. Over the
              long-term, many achievements have been made in economics; however,
              despite the multitude of studies and research that describe
              economic processes and their patterns, modern economic dynamics
              require new, combined, and most importantly visual and effective
              approaches to decision making, which will save time and,
              accordingly, reduce the likelihood of lost profits.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the progressive growth of the global economy and the
              concomitant onset of economic crises, there is an urgent need to
              forecast and model economic processes to form a strategy for
              sustainable development, balancing active government regulation
              and economic liberalism. The possibility to foresee and resolve a
              sudden situation has always been valued in economic theory.
              Unfortunately, in the course of economic analysis it is not
              possible to conduct controlled experiments. In our opinion, the
              solution to this problem may be the use of convergent technologies
              developed from natural systems that have proven themselves in
              areas other than the economy, where experimentation is applicable.
              In this paper, we propose to use the polymerase chain reaction
              (PCR) method, which is widely used in molecular biology, for the
              modelling of economic processes. This is a method used in the
              laboratory for the rapid cloning of a specific region of DNA,
              which in turn has a direct analogy with cellular DNA replication
              in biology and nuclear reactions in physics. We noticed that, in
              many respects, the main components of the PCR reaction mixture
              have direct analogues in economic processes, and that the
              principle of polymerase chain reaction can be successfully applied
              to describe some economic processes, including the incremental
              growth of the economic potential of a country.
            </p>
            <p>
              To begin with, we would like to more deeply draw an analogy
              between the convergent approach we are proposing for a chain-based
              innovative transformation of the economy (СITE) using the example
              of the revolutionary method used in molecular biology – PCR.
            </p>
            <p>
              Polymerase chain reaction is a method of rapid cloning
              (amplification) of a specific section of DNA in vitro during a
              programmed run of 30-40 cycles (Saiki et al., 1988). Polymerase
              chain reaction was invented by the American biochemist Kary Mullis
              in 1983. The availability and simplicity of PCR have made this
              method an indispensable application in various areas of molecular
              genetics research. The concept of PCR is based on the DNA template
              and short DNA fragments (primers) that limit the amplification
              region.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each PCR cycle consists of three stages: denaturation (separation
              of the complementary strands of DNA strands), annealing of primers
              (attachment to the DNA strands), and chain synthesis carried out
              by the DNA polymerase enzyme. The number of amplicons formed
              during PCR can be found by the following formula: A = (2n-2n)×k,
              where n is the number of cycles and k is the number of DNA
              matrices. Based on the formula, if there is one DNA template, the
              first two amplicons (the target PCR product) appear in the 3rd
              cycle. In the following cycles, the amplicons formed serve as
              matrices for the synthesis of new amplicons, which is why the
              reaction is called a chain reaction (Figure 1).
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Figure 1.</strong> PCR scheme: I, II, III (1st, 2nd and
              3rd cycles); 0 – DNA matrix; d – amplicons. The PCR cycle
              includes: a – denaturation, b – primer annealing, c – chain
              synthesis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, similar to the DNA matrix, we will create a matrix for the
              chain innovative transformation of the economy (CITE). Drawing an
              analogy with respect to the economy, there is a category without
              the existence of which it is difficult to imagine the functioning
              of any country. This is the gross domestic product (GDP), the
              total current market value of all final goods and services
              produced by the economy of a country over a certain period of time
              with the participation of all types of production within the
              national territory. All sectors of the economy associated with the
              consumption and accumulation of inventory values are taken into
              account, including exports, thus the GDP indicator includes all
              information about the structure of a nation’s economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our opinion, in the 21st century, the GDP matrix should be
              built based on the innovative potential of the country as the main
              source of GDP growth. The idea behind the creation of the GDP
              matrix is to obtain innovative products and opportunity matrices,
              which will be formed by chains of sectors of the economy using the
              following algorithm. The most innovatively developed sectors of
              the economy are located at the edges of the GDP matrix according
              to the queue (for example, 1-3-5-7-8-6-4-2). In such a scheme,
              innovatively less developed sectors of the economy, located in the
              middle of the GDP matrix, have the most contacts, which give them
              the opportunity to gain more skills and abilities (↑: high
              innovative growth; ↓: low innovative growth). The most distal
              sectors of the matrix have fewer contacts, but in view of greater
              economic development, they will generate the innovative ideas and
              be the last link forming or receiving the end-product (Figure 2).
              Thus, the extreme sectors of the GDP matrix are analogues of the
              primers in PCR and limit the scope of innovation amplification
              (Figure 1).

              using the example of 8 industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result, there is a progression (amplification) in the growth
              of the economic potential of the country with the advent of each
              new innovative product, i.e., there is an increase in new
              knowledge and skills (especially in the lagging sectors of the
              economy) with each new cycle of CITE, which leads to an increase
              in the number of opportunity matrices in the innovation aspect.
              Each newly formed matrix can serve as a basis for new ideas and
              products, i.e., the formed opportunity matrix (GDP') shows the
              ability to grow, and is similar to the amplicon in PCR.
            </p>
            <p>
              It should be noted that the ranking proposed by us (Figure 2) is
              not strict, but rather desirable, and other options for
              constructing a GDP matrix are possible (the 1st principle of the
              CITE concept); for example, a full matrix: 1-5-7-6-8-4-2-3, or a
              shortened one: 5-6-8-7-3. Presented in Figure 3, the topological
              scheme helps to clearly demonstrate that the most economically
              efficient situation occurs in the 2nd case, when the incremental
              growth occurs according to the formula 3n, where n is every other
              innovative cycle. In this instance, the most favourable conditions
              are created (a powerful flow of cash and innovations), which leads
              to their constant increase during the transition from sector to
              sector. This flow is created by the desire of sectors to make a
              profit. To us, this aspiration is analogous to a protein catalyst
              (DNA polymerase) in PCR. As a result, a new chain is being built,
              a new matrix leading to the formation of the next innovative
              product. Such a newly formed GDP matrix (or opportunity matrix) is
              a derivative of the original GDP matrix, with the difference that
              it has a higher potential to create a certain product and can be
              used to create another innovative product or an improved version
              of the previous one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since in the 2nd case the chain functions both in the forward
              (1→3→5→7→8→6→4→2) and in the opposite (1←3←5←7←8←6←4←2) direction,
              any new GDP' matrix (or opportunity matrix) formed can also work
              in both directions. This is due to the fact that the initial GDP
              matrix was innovatively growing in both directions; therefore, it
              will always be necessary to make small changes and implement
              modernization to continue producing new innovative products in
              both directions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most realistic situation is that of the 3rd case, when the
              growth of a new GDP' matrix does not occur from the very edge. It
              should be noted here that the middle portion (intersection) of the
              formed matrices grows most powerfully, according to the formula 2
              n + 1–1, and represents the ‘hot’ spot of innovations. If in the
              next set of cycles, the GDP matrix launches new innovative
              products formed within this ‘hot’ spot in both directions, as
              presented in the 2nd case, this will lead to an increase in the
              innovation potential of the median area according to the 3n
              formula. Cases 1 and 4, where the growth of the innovation
              potential is based on the 2n formula, are the least productive,
              but clearly show that, to obtain an innovative product, the
              longest intersectoral chain possible should be used, which should
              function in both directions with the formation of an intersection
              to create the maximum effect. Again, it should be noted that CITE
              does not force the economy to function in this way, but it clearly
              demonstrates how to optimize the incremental growth of the
              innovative potential of a country depending on the situation (the
              2nd principle of the CITE concept).
            </p>
            <p>
              It should also be noted that one of the most important properties
              of GDP matrices is their fractal nature. The fractality of GDP
              matrices is the ability of each individual segment of a matrix
              (cluster, enterprise, team of employees) to repeat in its
              functioning and development the properties of the entire matrix as
              a whole and to be reproduced at different scales with inherent
              features at each level. Thus, while each GDP matrix has its own
              dimension (national economy, cluster economy, enterprise), it
              retains at the same time all of its inherent functional
              properties. The structure of the GDP matrix is not constant and
              may become obsolete, thereby requiring its further evolutionary
              development (or adaptation). Such development may be manifested by
              the formation of new sectors of the economy or a significant
              improvement in the old ones. Each individual opportunity matrix
              (GDP') is a variant of the initial GDP matrix and is formed as the
              result of a chain innovation transformation based on the national
              economy. The total result of the functioning opportunity matrices
              at a certain point in time forms the total GDP matrix of the
              country.

              Also, we would like to emphasize that the proposed matrix allows
              us to determine the main sources of emerging ideas for CITE. This
              is confirmed by the history of the countries considered and the
              time periods over which their reforms occurred.
