        <strong>«Fly-Up»</strong> – is an infrastructure project, which is a
        platform for the placement and development of innovative ideas. What
        are the differences between the project and the usual StartUp
        platform?
      </section>
      <section>
        The project is based on the theory of the topological representation
        of economic processes and works in three directions:
        <p>
          I - intended for developers of “teams” (using the algorithm of the
          topological representation of economic processes on the world map
          represents those economic systems in which a request for innovative
          products is formed);
        </p>
        <p>
          II - for investors (allows, in addition to choosing the presented
          project presentations, to calculate possible cooperation options and
          financial results based on the algorithm of the topological
          presentation of economic processes);
        </p>
        <p>
          III - for researchers (allows initiative and active people who do
          not have professional programming skills, etc., to present the idea
          of their project and form (attract) a team of like-minded people to
          work on the project)
          <a
            href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/882609/growth-startup-funding-by-industry/"
          >
            growth-startup-funding-by-industry </a
          >. As recent studies have shown, all countries strive to enter the
          sphere of “open access” in many research areas, and there is an
          urgent need for the formation of such projects. Moreover, this niche
          is free in many countries. Why create a bike? Let's join forces to
          shape the digital infrastructure!

        <p>
          The peculiarity of the project is the use of the author’s
          development “Matrices of Opportunities for the Chain Innovative
          Transformation of the Economy:
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.33774/coe-2020-w07n6">CITE Concept</a>”
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>What do we want to achieve?</p>
        <p>
          First of all, the maximum concentration of thematic content, the
          formation of a discussion platform for the search for like-minded
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, to optimize the success of modern innovative products to
          the maximum and minimize the risks of failure.
